### 1. Main Landing (index.html)
The main entry point of the website serves as both a professional resume and an immersive introduction to the brand. Upon loading, the site triggers a custom initialization animation before revealing a scrollable layout that transitions from a resume section to a blog feed located below

* **Floating Widgets:** The page features animated floating elements (Guitar Pick, Camera Film, Rotring Pencil, Code Icon) that act as "mini-navigation" anchors to other sections.
* **Blog Integration:** Recent updates and thoughts are displayed dynamically as the user scrolls down.

### 2. Gallery (gallery.html)
This page acts as a visual archive for my photography and creative assets. It utilizes a masonry-style grid layout to display a collage of images from my camera roll.

* **Lightbox Mode:** Clicking any image expands it to a full-screen modal view for detailed viewing without leaving the page.

### 3. Music & Tabs (music.html)
A utility-focused page designed for musicians and followers, functioning as a hybrid between a database and a blog. Each song entry acts as a specific post containing performance notes and related media.

* **Tab Repository:** Supports downloadable PDF and text-based guitar tabs.
* **Media Integration:** Features embedded YouTube videos for covers and original performances.

### 4. Project Showcase (project.html)
A dedicated portfolio for technical work, specifically focusing on Unity game development and coding projects. The layout uses a modular card system to organize different works.

* **Project Cards:** Each project is displayed with a title and description.
* **Media Slideshows:** Cards include mini-carousels to showcase gameplay screenshots.
* **External Links:** Direct access to GitHub repositories and Itch.io builds via dedicated icons.

## Global Navigation
A persistent top bar exists across all pages to ensure consistent navigation. It is designed to auto-hide when scrolling down and reappear when scrolling up to maximize viewing space.

* **Signature:** Personal signature/logo located on the left.
* **Links:** Navigation items (Home, Gallery, Music, Projects) located on the right.
